## ðŸŽ¯ MVP Features

The goal of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to deliver the core functionality with a clean interface.

-   **Image Upload:** Users can upload a JPG, PNG, or HEIC image from their computer.
-   **Automatic Slicing:** The backend automatically slices the uploaded image into a user-defined grid of puzzle pieces.
-   **Interactive Puzzle Board:** A simple drag-and-drop interface where users can solve the puzzle.
-   **Snap-to-Grid:** Pieces snap into the correct position on the board.

## ðŸ’» Technology Stack

-   **Backend:** Python with the Flask web framework.
-   **Image Processing:** Pillow and pillow-heif libraries.
-   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project uses a standard Flask application structure to keep code organized and maintainable.
