## ðŸŽ¯ MVP Features

The goal of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to deliver the core functionality with a clean and responsive interface.

-   **Image Upload:** Users can upload a JPG, PNG, or HEIC image from their computer.
-   **Automatic Slicing:** The backend automatically slices the uploaded image into a user-defined grid of puzzle pieces.
-   **Interactive Puzzle Board:** A simple drag-and-drop interface where users can solve the puzzle.
-   **Snap-to-Grid:** Pieces snap into the correct position on the board.

## âœ¨ New Features
-   **Dynamic Layout:** The puzzle board and piece tray automatically resize to fit the browser window, ensuring the entire puzzle is always visible without scrolling for both landscape and portrait images.
-   **Seamless Completion:** Upon solving, the beveled pieces and grid lines fade away to reveal the seamless, original image, and a completion message appears in the piece tray.
-   **Reload to Restart:** Reloading the puzzle page redirects the user to the home screen to select a new image.

## ðŸ’» Technology Stack

-   **Backend:** Python with the Flask web framework.
-   **Image Processing:** Pillow and pillow-heif libraries.
-   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project uses a standard Flask application structure to keep code organized and maintainable.

```
jigsaw_puzzles/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py              # Main Flask application
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ static/             # For CSS, JavaScript, and static images
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/          # For HTML files
â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/            # Temporary storage for user-uploaded images
â””â”€â”€ output/             # Storage for generated puzzle pieces
```
